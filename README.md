# wtcw2_17339_yacht

This is my submission for CW2 in the Web Technology module. Not for professional use.

Yacht Luxe is a system for keeping an inventory of yachts, this can be for personal use, or can be used for people who want to create a database of yachts for borrowing from each other purposes or stuff like that. 

INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THE APP LOCALLY:
-type "npm init -y" in terminal
-type "npm i express express-validator pug body-parser nodemon" in terminal to install correct packages
-type "npm start" and you will see a message that says "Server running on port 2025"
-go to "http://localhost:2025/" in your local browser to see the web application.
